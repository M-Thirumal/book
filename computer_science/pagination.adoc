== Offset Based Pagination

=== Traverse Forward

=== Traverse backward

== Token Based Pagination

=== Traverse Forward

`nextToken` is used to specify the record after which additional items should be fetched, along with the page size. 

The implementation of the token is system-specific.

`DynamoDB` is an example of at system that uses `token-pagination`

=== Traverse backward


== Pagination in Graph

Vertices can be refered directly but when we execute a graph traversal we are effectively conducting a complex join among the vertices that take part in the traversal.

 In the general case, to support pagination, we need to store some state for each of the participating node and edge, as each of them may contribute to the final output during the computation of the next page.
